Rotate 2D Array (Image)
============

You are given an n x n 2D matrix that represents an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

###### Example

For

``` bash
a = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]]
```     
###### the output should be

``` bash
rotateImage(a) =
    [[7, 4, 1],
     [8, 5, 2],
     [9, 6, 3]]
```

Fiz-Buzz
============
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.[1] Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".


First Non-Repeating Character
============

Given a string s, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

###### Example

For s = "abacabad", the output should be firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.


Sort Me
============

sorts the items of an array. The sort order can be either alphabetic or numeric, and either ascending (up) or descending (down).
